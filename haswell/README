PREREQUISITES
=======
This custom metric is designed specifically for an Intel Haswell (Xeon v3) CPU.
PAPI must also be available on the system on which the metric is installed and
run.

A C++11 compiler is required to compile the metric. Unless specified, the
default value of variable CXX is used for the C++ compiler.

The environment variable ARM_FORGE_CONFIG_DIR must be set to point to the
location of the Arm Forge Metrics SDK, which is typically in the map/metrics
sub-folder of the Arm Forge installation directory. For example, if Arm Forge
is installed in ${ARM_FORGE_INSTALL_DIR} then the Arm Forge Metrics SDK is in
folder ${ARM_FORGE_INSTALL_DIR}/map/metrics

INSTALLATION
=======
Set the environment variables as outlined in the prerequisites. Ensure that the
PAPI headers and libraries are loaded, and run

make
make install

This will install the custom metric in the ${HOME}/.allinea/map/metrics folder.
