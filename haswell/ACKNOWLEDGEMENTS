The work presented in the code is based upon the research from the following
research paper.

Detecting Memory-Boundedness with Hardware Performance Counters, Molka, D. and
Schöne, R. and Hackenberg, D. and Nagel, W. E., ICPE '17, Proceedings of the
8th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering, Pages 27-38

Thanks also go to John Wohlbier and Michael Stokes of Engility for their time
and interesting discussions, as well as for bringing the above paper to the
attention of the Arm Forge team.

The custom metric included here implements the collection of the hardware
counters identified in the above paper for catergorising memory stall reasons
as either being bandwidth or latency bound. The hardware counters collected are
only known to be accurate for this purpose on the Intel® Xeon® E5 v3 processor
family. The PAPI library is also required for data to be gathered. For more
information see the README document in this folder.
