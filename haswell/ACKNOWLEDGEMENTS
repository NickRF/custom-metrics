The work presented in the code is based upon the research from the following
research paper.

Detecting Memory-Boundedness with Hardware Performance Counters, Molka, D. and
Sch√∂ne, R. and Hackenberg, D. and Nagel, W. E., ICPE '17, Proceedings of the
8th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering, Pages 27-38

The custom metric implements the collection of the hardware counters identified
in the above paper for catergorising memory stall reasons as either being
bandwidth or latency bound. The hardware counters collected are only known to
be accurate for this purpose on an Intel Haswell (Xeon v3) CPU on which PAPI is
installed. For more information see the README document in this folder.
